**I love computers.**

Who am I?  
What I do?  
WHY I do it?  


Share my values??
Write the way you talk


Scope narrow a relevant
what is my site for


Highlight the kind of work you want to be doing.
Tell the truth in your own voice.
Read it aloud to make sure it sounds like you.
Treat it as a draft. Share it early and update it regularly.


Give yourself at least two minutes with each of these exercises. (You may want to grab tea or coffee, a favorite notebook, and a timer.)

Where do you see yourself in one to three years?
How does your work fit into the world you want to live in?
What kinds of projects interest you? (It sometimes helps to list tasks you want to stop doing first.)
What kinds of people do you want to work with? Who are your dream clients?
What do you want people to do after visiting your website (e.g., hire you, subscribe to your blog)?
If someone were telling a potential client about you, what would you want them to say?


Gather ideas

Next, make a list of different kinds of information you might include. We’re still exploring here, so don’t worry about finding the “perfect” words just yet. (I like to use sticky notes to gather ideas so I can arrange them visually afterwards.)

Start with the basics. About pages don’t have to be cutesy or clever. A simple bio with concrete facts goes a long way. Tell us who you are, where you’re from (if it matters to you), where you live, and what you do. And if you have a photo or video of yourself you want to share, make a note to include that.

Share your experience. What are you most proud of? This isn’t your CV, so don’t worry about outlining every job you’ve ever had. Summarize your biggest accomplishments, and feel free to link to publications, talks, interviews, events, or recent clients. If you’re a freelancer, you may want to include a short list of skills or services you offer.


Write a short bio

Pick a small section of your About page to begin with. A quick Mad Libs exercise can help you write your bio. Look back at your notes as you fill in the blanks:

I’m a ______.
I help ______ {make/build} ______.
When I’m not ______, you can find me ______.
Want to work together? I’d love to hear from you.

Play with the structure and rewrite it until it sounds like you. When you’re happy with it, use it as a headline or the first part of your longer bio. (If you like these kinds of exercises, Alexandra Franzen has some great ones on her site.)


Once you have a rough draft, take it to the next level:

Make it sound like you. Use simple words you’d say to a friend or neighbor. Skip the industry jargon, unless your clients are looking for common keywords like responsive web design or mindfulness coaching.

Be honest. This is the perfect place to show your true colors. Don’t say you love collaborating if you’d rather work alone. Tell the truth, and if something’s hard to express, think about how you’d explain it in person. It’s better to be upfront than to have to reveal these details at your first client meeting.

Keep it short and sweet. Check over your main points. Is the most important information at the top? Don’t overcomplicate things with hefty phrasing. Try to limit your sentences to one main idea with 20 words or fewer.

Read it out loud. Editing is about listening, so listen to your writing. Read it aloud in a quiet room. You’ll naturally notice where the words are jumbled, repetitive, or imprecise. Ask yourself:

    Is it clear?
    Does it sound like you?
    Is every word true?
    Can you cut any adjectives or modifiers?
